    <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
    <p>
        With 4 years in software development, I began as an Associate Software Developer at Integrate and advanced to
        Software Engineer. I also have experience from Space Applications Centre, ISRO, and QUEST Alliance. Currently,
        as a Full-Stack Developer at Integrate, a leader in B2B marketing technology, I’ve developed applications using
        React, C#, .NET, Angular, and MongoDB. My skills span Object-Oriented Programming, Data Structures, Web
        Development, and include technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C++, Git, Java, Spring Boot, and MySQL. Key
        achievements include launching a bulk update feature, integrating MDXEditor and Markdig, and creating dynamic
        HTML templates with ChatGPT.
